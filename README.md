</p>

**Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI)** is pivotal in breast cancer diagnosis, yet radiologists face challenges in interpreting its complex data due to the lack of robust automated tools. Current systems are limited by small datasets and insufficient integration of clinical expertise.  

**BLADE** is a novel framework that synergizes **deep learning with clinical domain knowledge** to address these gaps. It leverages:  
- A **pre-trained vertical foundation model** (trained on 2.1 million MRI slices) for robust feature extraction.  
- **Hemodynamic prior knowledge** to emulate radiologistsâ€™ diagnostic reasoning.  
- A **BI-RADS-based constraint** during training to align predictions with clinical standards.  

BLADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalizability, and serves as an effective assistive tool, **improving radiologistsâ€™ diagnostic accuracy by 14.31%**.  


## Key Contributions  
1. **Dataset & Foundation Model**:  
   - Curated **17,149 breast MRI volumes** (2.5 million slices) from global multi-center data.  
   - Pre-trained **MoCoMed**, an MRI foundation model, on 14,070 volumes (2.1 million slices) to enhance downstream task performance.  

2. **Domain-Integrated Framework**:  
   - Fuses **multi-phase DCE-MRI** information to mimic clinical time-intensity curve analysis.  
   - Introduces a **BI-RADS-aligned training constraint**, reducing false positives/negatives and improving interpretability.  

3. **Clinical Impact**:  
   - Achieves **superior performance** over SOTA methods, with strong generalization on external datasets.  
   - Boosts radiologistsâ€™ efficiency and diagnostic accuracy (**+14.31%**) when used as an assistive tool.
